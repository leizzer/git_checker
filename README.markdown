It is useful for keep an eye on your git repositories, what branch has been not merged yet, commits not in some branch and more.

"It's like a Test for your git"

Install:
--------

`gem install git_checker`

Usage:
------

Create a file with the extension .gck.rb

    touch checkthis.gck.rb

Add some checks in that file, like:

    #checkthis.gck.rb
    local = Repository.new
    commits_not_in local.branches['master'], local

Then run the command: 
`gck`

More:
-----

You can also ask for run task that you not always want, like this:

    #checkthis.gck.rb
    local= Repository.new
    remote= Repository.new 'remote'

    commits_not_in local.branches['master'], local

    check_group "Check for branches not in Remote?" do
      branches_not_in remote, local
    end #>>> Check for branches not in Remote? [y/n]

You can skip this questions an run all with the command `agck`
